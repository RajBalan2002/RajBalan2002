## Hi there 👋
I’m Raj
I’m a Computer Engineering graduate student with a strong focus on ASIC/FPGA Design & Verification and Embedded Systems. I enjoy building reliable, high-performance hardware—from RTL design and UVM-based verification to FPGA prototyping and system bring-up.

🔧 What I work on
ASIC / FPGA Design & Verification: RTL (Verilog/SystemVerilog), UVM, functional & coverage-driven verification
Computer Architecture: Pipelined processors, AXI/I2C protocols, SoC-level concepts
Embedded Systems: Bare-metal & RTOS-based firmware, hardware/software integration
Automation & Tooling: Regression scripting, test automation, workflow optimization

🧠 Technical Skills
HDL: Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL
Verification: UVM, functional coverage, assertions, waveform debugging
Programming: C, C++, Python, Tcl
EDA & Tools: Vivado, ModelSim/Questa, Synopsys VCS (simulation), Git
Platforms: FPGA (Basys/Xilinx), embedded MCUs, lab bring-up

🚀 What I’m aiming for
I’m actively seeking internship and full-time roles in Design Verification, ASIC/FPGA Design, and Embedded Systems, where I can contribute to production-quality hardware and continue learning from industry experts.
